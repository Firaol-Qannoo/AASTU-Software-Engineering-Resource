## üåü Welcome to Software Engineering Resources

This repository is a collaborative effort by **Addis Ababa Science and Technology University (AASTU)** Software Engineering students. Our mission is to create a centralized, well-organized, and easily accessible collection of learning resources such as books, PPTs, PDFs, code snippets, tests, and assignments. Together, we aim to empower students by sharing knowledge and supporting academic success.

Most resources are scattered or poorly organized. Our main goal is:

- Providing a platform for students to practice and improve their Git and collaboration skills.

The **website is automatically generated** from the resources in this repository using modern web technologies, ensuring it stays up-to-date with the latest contributions.
