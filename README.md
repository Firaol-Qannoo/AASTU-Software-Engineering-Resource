# üßê Project Idea

> Most of resources are there but not orginazed, our main goal is collecting books, ppt, pdf, codes, test, assignments and making it available for every one.
> And also you can practice your git skill by cloning and pushing to this repo
**Any Idea? [Contact the Me](https://t.me/realgemechis).**
